mClassroom
==========

mClassroom is an application which enables the different entities of a common classroom environment to facilitate and collaborate by leveraging the power of technology. This application introduces learning based on discovery and feedback based teaching. The condition of education is very depressing here in our country, and we believe we can change that. Out of 10 students that enroll in grade one, only 7 make it to grade five.. and of those 7, only four make it to grade ten. Introducing interesting education materials in accordance to the lesson plan and also equipping the kids with necessary life skills, we believe that we can manage to reduce the dropout rate. The application will also feature an online store that allows to buy school supplies and tech devices that are required for schools. Buying in bulk and from an online store reduces costs for the school. The revenue generated from the store will be used to fund the Learning Management System, this will ensure the free use of the application for learners and educators.
